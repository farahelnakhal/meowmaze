# 🐱 MeowMaze

**MeowMaze** is a Pac-Man-inspired maze game where you play as a campus cat collecting fish, dodging dogs and cucumbers, and navigating through fun, chaotic levels.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the cat.
- Collect all fish before time runs out.
- Avoid lethal obstacles (🐶 dog, 🥒 cucumber) — they reduce lives.
- Non-lethal obstacles (🧶 yarn, 🧹 vacuum) slow or push you back.
- Survive all 3 levels (increasing difficulty) to win!

## 🧠 Game Logic
- You start with **9 lives** per level.
- If you lose all lives or run out of time: **Game Over**.
- Each level has its own timer.
- Fish give you points, and there are hidden power-ups too!
